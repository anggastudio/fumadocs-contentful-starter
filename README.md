npm run dev
```

## Demo
here | https://fumadocs-contentful-starter.anggastudio.dev/

## Why created this?
This is a demo to show you the power of Fumadocs in creating documentation website.
You can go to fumadocs's docs and try it's quick-start `npm create fumadocs-app` command.
But, you will only get...
the very basic template content.
And it is not even close to the beautiful fumadocs's docs itself.

So, You can use this repo as a starter to create your own documentation website (powered by fumadocs).

PS: I actually would be happy if Fuma himself can make cli command to create contentful starter
