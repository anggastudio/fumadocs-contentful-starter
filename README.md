# Quick Start
Clone this repo, npm install, and there you go, just focus on creating content

#### Clone
``` bash
git clone
git clone https://github.com/anggastudio/fumadocs-contentful-starter.git
```
#### Install
``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Demo
here | https://fumadocs-contentful-starter.anggastudio.dev/

## Why created this?
This is a demo to show you the power of Fumadocs in creating documentation website
You can go to fumadocs's docs and try it's quick-start `npm create fumadocs-app` command.
But, you will only get...
The very basic template content
It is not even close to the beautiful fumadocs's docs

---
PS: I actually would be happy if Fuma himself can make cli command to create contentful starter
